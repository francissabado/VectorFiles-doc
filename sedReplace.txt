You can use sed as:

sed 's/\t/,/g' input_file > output_file

This will keep the input file unchanged and will create a new file output_file with the changes.

If you want to change the input file itself without creating a new file you can use -i option to sed to do inplace changes:

sed -i 's/\t/,/g' input_file
